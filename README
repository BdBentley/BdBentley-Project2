Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to create an investment account that could be tracked over time and represent an account with and without monthly deposits. The accounsts were made for a company called Airgead Banking.

What did you do particularly well?
I beleive that my flowchart was alright, except looking back on this program I forgot to actually add in the input validation for creating the account.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Create the input validation while loop before the code executres to ensure that the user had used the correct input. Otherwise you will get some wonky errors.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I believe that setting up and calling objects can be difficult, however in general I just plan on working with C++ more in the future.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Doing math operations and having your code give the correct output. Also even though I didn't get to it, making sure that the user has given the correct data through input validation will carry over to every program.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I believe the comments I put in this program were readable. However the code can definitely be refactored as well as adding a while loop.
